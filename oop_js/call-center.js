/*
At a call center there are three levels of employees:
respondent, manager, and director. An incoming call
must be first allocated to a respondent who is free.
If she cannot handle the call, she must escalate the
call to a manager. If the manager cannot handle the
call, the call should be escalated to a director.
Design the classes and data structures for this
problem. Implement a `dispatchCall` method which
assigns a call to the first available employee.
